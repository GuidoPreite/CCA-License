# CCA License
The CCA License (CCA stands for Community Contributor Awareness) is a permissive sofware license based on the MIT License.\
The difference is how the permission is granted: a donation made to the clause highlighted inside the license is required to be complaint.\
The donation clause explains how the author would like to support the community.

The template is the following:
